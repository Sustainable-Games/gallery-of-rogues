## A museum honoring Rogue and Roguelikes

A game created for Bitsy Fest 2023.

This is an homage to the classic ASCII text game, _Rogue_, and some of the games inspired by it.

Each room features a level in the style of the particular game being honored. If you survive the level, you move on to the next room in the museum. If you die, just as is true in the original game, you go back to the entrance of the museum. Hope you enjoy this tribute to the classic that founded an entire genre of games.
